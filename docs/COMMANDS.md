# Common Commands

Run all commands from the **root directory**.

## Development & Build

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server (orchestrates frontend and backend via `scripts/dev.mjs`).
- `npm run build`: Builds both frontend and backend workspaces.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.

## Testing & Quality

- `npm test` or `npm run test:watch`: Runs Vitest test suite.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase with the root ESLint flat config.
- `npx prettier --write .`: Formats code.

Before finishing code changes, run the project quality gate from the root:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```

In sandboxed agent environments, `npm test` may need permission to bind a local port for Supertest. If it fails with `listen EPERM`, rerun the same command with the required permission.

## Database Operations

- `npm run db:generate`: Generates Drizzle migrations.
- `npm run db:migrate`: Runs pending migrations.

## Troubleshooting

- `npm run reset` / `npm run doctor`: Cleans or troubleshoots local state.
