# Weather Starter

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/optiflow/weather_starter)

Weather Starter is a full-stack TypeScript app for saving Singapore locations and viewing the latest local weather snapshot for each one. It is built as an npm workspaces monorepo with a React/Vite dashboard, an Express API, SQLite persistence through Drizzle ORM, and Singapore data.gov.sg weather endpoints.

The project is intentionally small enough to study end to end, but complete enough to exercise real full-stack workflows: location creation, browser geolocation, API validation, provider aggregation, persistence, refresh behavior, frontend state, responsive dashboard UI, and local documentation.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The root dev command runs Express and Vite middleware in one Node process behind Portless. Open the URL printed by Portless. The default local URL is usually:

```text
http://weather-starter.localhost:1355
```

Start the docs site:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Before finishing changes, run the root quality gate:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## What It Does

- Saves Singapore coordinates manually through the dashboard.
- Adds the nearest Singapore 2-hour forecast area from browser geolocation with **Use my location**.
- Lists, selects, refreshes, and deletes saved locations.
- Stores one latest weather snapshot per location in `backend/weather.db`.
- Shows 2-hour forecast text, realtime temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, UV, air quality, 24-hour forecast periods, and a 4-day outlook.
- Renders a responsive React dashboard with a sidebar, selected-location hero, weather metric tiles, theme switching, and a Leaflet map.
- Keeps detailed architecture, API, schema, component, and configuration docs in the `docs/` workspace.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet |
| Backend | Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Pino |
| Persistence | SQLite, Drizzle ORM, generated Drizzle migrations |
| Docs | Astro Starlight, Mermaid diagrams |
| Dev URL | Portless named `.localhost` URL |
| External API | Singapore data.gov.sg weather APIs |

## Architecture

  Browser["Browser\nReact + Vite dashboard"] --> Portless["Portless\nweather-starter.localhost:1355"]
  Portless --> Express["Express app\n/api routes + Vite middleware"]
  Express --> SQLite["SQLite\nbackend/weather.db"]
  Express --> Weather["SingaporeWeatherClient"]
  Weather --> Gov["data.gov.sg weather APIs"]
```

In development, `scripts/dev.mjs` starts the backend with Vite loaded as middleware, so the browser can use relative `/api` requests without a separate frontend proxy. In production, the compiled backend serves `frontend/dist` as static files.

The app uses a snapshot model: saved locations keep the latest persisted weather data, and refresh actions fetch a new snapshot from data.gov.sg.

## Common Commands

Run commands from the repository root.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the full app through Portless. |
| `npm run docs` | Start the Astro Starlight docs site. |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest and Supertest backend tests. |
| `npm run build` | Build the frontend and compile backend TypeScript. |
| `npm run lint` | Run Biome checks. |
| `npm run format` | Format the repo with Biome. |
| `npm run start` | Run the compiled production server. |
| `npm run doctor` | Verify local health and API behavior. |
| `npm run reset` | Reset local state such as the SQLite database. |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes. |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply Drizzle migrations. |

See [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md) and [configuration reference](docs/src/content/docs/reference/configuration.md) for the full command and environment reference.

## API Overview

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check. |
| `GET` | `/api/locations` | List saved locations. |
| `POST` | `/api/locations` | Create a location from explicit coordinates. |
| `POST` | `/api/locations/from-position` | Add or select the nearest forecast area from browser coordinates. |
| `GET` | `/api/locations/:id` | Get one saved location. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/locations/:id` | Delete a saved location. |
| `POST` | `/api/locations/:id/refresh` | Refresh weather for a saved location. |
| `POST` | `/api/logs` | Record frontend interaction events through the backend logger. |

Full request, response, validation, and error behavior is documented in [API Endpoints](docs/src/content/docs/reference/api-endpoints.md).

## External Weather Data

The app reads Singapore weather data from `api-open.data.gov.sg` and `api.data.gov.sg`. It works without an API key for light local usage. Set `WEATHER_API_KEY` if you need higher provider limits:

```bash
export WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
npm run dev
```

The weather client aggregates 2-hour forecast data, realtime station readings, UV, air quality, 24-hour forecast periods, and the 4-day outlook. Provider details live in [Weather Data](docs/src/content/docs/guides/weather-data.md).

## Roadmap

- Singapore forecast-area picker to replace manual latitude/longitude entry.
- Historical readings and charts instead of one latest snapshot per location.
- Multi-location management with sorting, primary location selection, and mobile-friendly controls.
