# Repo Quality Gate

Use this skill before finishing any code or documentation task in `weather-starter`.

## Workflow

Run commands from the repository root:

1. `npm test`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run lint`
4. Review `/docs` for files affected by the change and update them when behavior, commands, architecture, or conventions changed.

## Notes

- The Vitest API tests use Supertest and may need permission to bind a local port in sandboxed environments. If `npm test` fails with `listen EPERM`, rerun it with escalation rather than treating it as an app failure.
- Keep verification output concise in the final response: report pass/fail for each check and call out anything not run.
- Do not run workspace commands from `frontend/` or `backend/` unless a task specifically requires a workspace-local command.
